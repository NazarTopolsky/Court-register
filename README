Simple scraper for reyestr.court.gov.ua and site.
Use the scraper to retrieve data from site, store it into Neo4j database. Then you can use the site to watch the results.
The site is not particulary stable, but it works.

Was written in Python. Due to the site containing UTF data Python3 was used, previous version compability is no guaranteed.

Scraper was written using lxml library: http://lxml.de/
Graph rendering: D3.js library: http://d3js.org/
DB is accessed using neo4jrestclient: http://neo4j-rest-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/info.html
Data storage: Neo4j: http://neo4j.com/ (tested with 2.2.1 version. However, nothing should break off with other ones).
Site operated by Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/

Dependencies:
General: Neo4j
JS: D3.js (included in repo)
Python:
	python3
	Scraper:
		requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
		py2neo: http://py2neo.org/2.0/
		lxml: http://lxml.de/
	Site:

Using:
First you need to collect data.
Make sure you have Neo4j database running on default port (you have to configure source files if otherwise) and that you have working Internet connection.
Assuming you are in project parent directory, run 'python3 scraper/scraper.py' to start. You don't have to do anything, script will notify you when it is done. Now you have info in your Neo4j database.
To start server, type 'python3 CourtRegister/CourtRegister.py' (again, assuming you are in project parent directory). Follow the link from the output to view it.

Feel free to use the project and its source code.
